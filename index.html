			  <h1>Welcome to my Profile</h1>
			  <p>My name is Daniel Chinh Quoc Tran, I am an Australian born male, with Vietnamese ethnicity and as such I am bilingual 
			  in Vietnamese and English. I studied at Mount Waverley Secondary College for my primary education and Mount Waverley Secondary College 
			  for my secondary college and in VCE I took upon the subjects of English, Mathematical Methods, Business Management, History Revolutions
			  and Visual Communication. An interesting fact about myself is that I have coached youth basketball for three years, before the COVID pandemic. </p>
			  <p>There are quite a number of things that you could try doing...</p>

				<h2>Personality Test</h2>
			</header>
		
			<p>The results of the 16 personality test implies that my character according to their criteria is as a 
			leader and moral leader to push the right thing to do. The result of my learning styles test concludes that while
			I draw from all three learning styles, my capability of learning comes best through visual learning, which may use 
			graphical tools such as diagrams, graphs or pictures to help better understand learning material or concepts. The result 
			of my personality trait score indicate that I lean towards the dimension of Openness, which is the tendency to think in
			abstract ways to produce and play with new ideas, which may translate to greater understand of artistic expression, the 
			other dimension that the test has indicated that I lean towards is the dimension of Extraversion, which is the inclination 
			to pursue stimulation from the outside world through engagement with others to earn friendship, admiration, status and 
			excitement. These results may demonstrate that my position in a team may fall unto me, the responsibility to lead the moral 
			direction of the team, as well as to provide innovation through new ideas and methods. It also may demonstrate that I will
			willingly be able to create bonds with team members because of my inclination to pursue stimulation from the outside world. 
			Based on these findings, I should long to form a team that covers my weaknesses which are practical, more concrete thinkers
			as well as idealism limiters to keep practicality and reason within the project the team may be working on. It also suggests 
			that I may require another leader figure within the group to rationalise arguments and suggestions made by other members, 
			so that I do not tunnel vision on my own interpretation of what a successful strategy or successful direction for the group is.
			While these tests may provide a basic indication or direction to where my learning styles, personality or traits maybe, an
			online test may likely not be able to fully realise all the nuances and idiosyncrasies into a human personality, as 
			they user in question, me, may not have been able to answer the questions to the best of their ability, because some 
			questions I either may not know enough about myself, or I may have misevaluated the category to which I belong to, either
			providing an under evaluation or an over evaluation to myself. To apply this to these tests, why I think I may be a decent leader,
			I do not think I would be moral, because I have yet to fully develop the skills to actualise the correct concept of morality in the 
			context of a team of people, that can cater towards the individualities of each person. And while I agree with the learning style tests, 
			I do not agree with the five big personality trait assessments, as I am not really a social person that actively seeks communal engagement, 
			as while I do like having group settings and am not adverse to social interaction, I often work alone on projects.

				<h2>My Background</h2>
			</header>
			
				<section>
					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<pMy interest in IT is limited to that of what I have been exposed to in my environment, which could grow broader in 
					time and experience, these interests currently being in cybersecurity, data analytics. The reason I have found interest 
					in these two topics is because from a young age I had been exposed to cybersecurity because of my father’s involvement 
					within the industry and his stories to follow while working, and while I do not yet have the skills, I am very willing to 
					explore how we can use IT to protect data. Data Analytics has been an interest I have developed after playing a decent amount 
					of competitive games, the relationship that I have observed being that Data Analytics are often used as a foundation to determine 
					what changes must be made in the game to make the experience healthier by observing and analysing raw data and statistics 
					to make the game healthier, less frustrating and overall better for the players in, layman’s terms this is called balancing. 
					While I do not have any professional experience within IT, I did gain a basic grasp of what IT is about through my VCE subject
					3 and 4, Software Development and have also accrued basic programming skills on Visual Basic and the associated documentation
					regarding those software that I had made. 
</p>
					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Expectations at RMIT</h3>
					<p>I chose to go to RMIT because I wished to continue into tertiary education to find applicable skills for the workforce within the sector of IT.
					I had also heard of RMIT's upstanding reputation within IT education and decided it was suitable for the intentions I had. During my three years 
					studying Bachelor of Information Technology I hope to learn, then leave with skills that I can use within the workforce, particularly that upon the 
					broader end, so I can flex into many different positions because of how quickly changing the IT industry is. </br>
					 </br>
					University level education ranging from 1st year to Post Grad students through RMIT on campus and online via Open University Australia</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>Competitive Video games</h3>
					<p>While there I don't have formal education in philosophy it is very much an interest of mine.</p>
					<p>Always interested in reading and learning more! I can not recommend having another interest enough outside of Information Technology. Such development and passion in other areas can only benefit you more.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>			  
			<p>The manager of game design in valorant is responsible for ensuring VALORANT design teams are working at peak performance by 
			working with them to develop the vision for gameplay and systems of VALORANT. They manage and coach designers to ensure execution
			in gameplay, and to build positive relationships across other teams at Riot. The requirements and qualifications are a minimum of
			five years in game design, and to have this successfully transfer into the delivery of those projects. They also need 1 years 
			worth of people management experience through experience of mentorship that has led to positive improvements in the mentee’s work. 
			Outside of the specific requirements they also need experience within creating systemic change improving the design team’s process 
			or principles as well as people skills such as leadership, conflict resolution and communication. They also prefer, but do not 
			require experience working on, as well as understanding the tactical principles of First Person Shooters (FPS) as VALORANT is an 
			FPS competitive online game to provide solutions to problems relating to the mechanics and technicalities in gameplay. As of now,
			while I do have a passionate interest and I had plenty of experience playing and a decent understanding of development theory, 
			from studying gameplay developer podcasts about self evaluation on their work relating to FPS genre and the broader majority of 
			competitive online games such as concepts surrounding ability efficacy, healthy versus balanced gameplay and universal appeal of 
			gameplay design, I have neither the skills nor the qualifications to apply this knowledge as well as experience into industry practice. 
			The only way to obtain industry experience is to work, and engage with the industry, which I will need to acquire general and 
			specific skills from my time studying the bachelor of IT, such as networking and data analytics, and time outside of tertiary study 
			to continue to engage and obtain a greater understanding of the category specific theory of First Person shooters and other competitive
			online games. After developing these skills, I plan to accrue technical experience from lower level positions in the gaming industry, 
			which may possibly result in having to move to other countries such as America or China for more opportunities regarding the company of 
			my ideal job. I will also attempt to connect with industry related businesses and organisations through industry meet and greets or other 
			events to not only gain interpersonal experience, but also to obtain a greater insight to the industry I wish to work in. This should help 
			in working towards a position of management in game design to prove myself a candidate with enough capacity to lead and maintain a 
			team, after obtaining the technical experience from working several years.</p>

		<h> Ideal Job </h>
		<h> Overview </h>
		<p>The project is to create a system that can take input from users who will send their Video-On-Demand (VOD) of
		two competitive games VALORANT and League of Legends to a pool of users who have been verified to be of higher skill 
		rating in those respective games. Out of the pool of users, those that choose to review that VOD can add comments to 
		potential improvements to that gameplay. The system should contain technical jargon and imagery that is appropriate to 
		the audience of competitive VALORANT and League of Legends to appeal towards them, and should be welcoming to that of
		newer skill levels, as that will be more than half of the users, who will be on the lower end of the skill spectrum. 
		It should also allow sender of the VODs to connect with their respective reviewers, if they have any other inquiries. </p>
		<h> Motivation </h>
		<p> The motivation for this project is to provide a more convenient way for players that play League of Legends and/or 
		VALORANT competitively to improve by getting help from players that are better than them. Currently many players from 
		both games struggle finding a more generalist, new player friendly approach, as the one of the most popular forums for 
		this purpose: League of Legends boards which was an official platform by RIOT had been shut down in March, 2020. The 
		remaining platforms such as Reddit or Discord, were either too difficult to navigate for users that had not already been 
		using the platform, or the platform was too insular and did not have a wide enough perspective to fit the requirements 
		of newer or improving players. As such a system specifically designed to cater towards people who wanted to improve or 
		improve others in VALORANT and League of Legends was done to fit the gap in the market that had not yet been filled by 
		existing platforms and systems. </p>
		<h> SYSTEM DESCRIPTION </h>
		<p> The features of the system are that it will have a login key for user and administrator access to allow for personalised
		features such as specific feedback. It will also be used to verify the rank of the players using the system as well as to link both 
		their VALORANT and League of Legends accounts towards the system as both of them share the same account from RIOT games, the developer 
		for both games. The system will have a software with a central access page where the user can access existing and prior patch notes,
		then a tab where it will swap pages to where the user can access their feedback from the VODs they had sent, as well as another tab to
		where they can publicise their own VODs to pending for review, and to review other VODs of users equal or below their skill level. The 
		software should have clear indicators of what feedback came from what user and allow all users to access a visual profile of other users. 
		The software uses technical jargon appropriate to that of VALORANT and League of Legends and should contain definitions for most of them. 
		The software should allow the users who are reviewing others to clip sections of the VOD to highlight certain events in the gameplay of the 
		user who is being reviewed. In the same vein the software should also have basic drawing features to allow users reviewing to have the ability 
		to direct towards certain features of an event during the gameplay VOD, or towards certain teaching points within the VOD. The software 
		aesthetically should contain imagery relevant to both VALORANT and League of legends as a graphical form of guiding the user through the software. 
		It should also use a minimalist design to prevent visual and literary clutter among the screen such as modern geometric design, using drop 
		down boxes for larger chunks of feedback from users reviewing VODs and polygonal shapes. The software should also be able to receive basic 
		feedback from users about their reviewers about how helpful, accurate or concise the information was, and portray the information to users, 
		so it reflects how helpful they may be towards other users, this may be reflected in positive marks or negative marks, similar to that of other social
		media platforms such as youtube and reddit, where the users overall rating score will be affected by the following the 
		difference between positive and negative marks as their total score. Users can then filter based on rank, or feedback marks to target specific 
		users to receive VODs for them. The system should be window based so that users can have it in the background if they are focusing on other tasks 
		outside of the software, and it should be able to function in both full screen and a minimised tab. </p>
		<h> Tools and Technologies </h>
		<p> The software I will likely be using is either compilers, visual basic or python as the capabilities of designing a software with a visual 
		interface will likely match the requirements that I need for the project. I will likely be drawing from the RIOT database of information, to 
		link accounts of VALORANT and League of Legends with the program so that users of the software can view the in-game profiles of the other users. 
		I will also be using a desktop, mouse and keyboard to program this, and I might need a platform to host the servers for the project, though I have
		yet to acquire the specific skills and knowledge in that category. </p>
		<h> Skills Required </h>
		<p> The skills required that I will have to learn in depth are either Python or Visual basic. I should also learn deeper into the ethics of 
		collecting information as well as how to link a database towards a visual basic or python program. I may also require skills within graphic 
		design programs such as Adobe Illustrator or Microsoft indesign to put together a design that is both visually appealing and function simple 
		enough to navigate for users that have not had a large amount of experience. I may also require knowledge on how to host a server to trial the 
		program online. </p>
		<h> Outcome </h>
		<p> If the project is successful, the gap in the market that exists for new players to find help, or experienced players to help others with 
		their gameplay in VALORANT and League of Legends should be filled because the program should be a reasonable solution as it has matched these 
		new players with other players who are willing to help. The users should also find that the software is functionally easy to use and that the 
		software meets their expectations on how it should perform. This should help impact the market by providing more user specific/user catered designs, 
		and encourage more targeting towards the individual rather than the collective. </p>
